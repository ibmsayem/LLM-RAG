       "'The error \"invalid reference format: repository name must be lowercase\" typically occurs when mapping volumes on Windows using Docker. Windows paths can sometimes cause issues if there are spaces in the directory names or if the path format is not correctly specified.\\n\\nTo resolve this issue, try the following steps:\\n\\n1. **Remove Spaces in Directory Paths:**\\n   Ensure that the directory path does not contain spaces. For example, if your code is in `C:/Users/Alexey Grigorev/git/...`, move it to `C:/git/...`.\\n\\n2. **Use Alternative Path Formats:**\\n   Instead of using the typical `-v` syntax, try these options:\\n   ```bash\\n   -v /c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\\n   -v //c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\\n   -v /c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\\n   -v //c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\\n   --volume //driveletter/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data/:/var/lib/postgresql/data\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Use Quotes Around Paths:**\\n   Adding quotes around the volume mapping might also help:\\n   ```bash\\n   -v \"/c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"\\n   -v \"//c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"\\n   -v \"/c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"\\n   -v \"//c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"\\n   -v \"c:\\\\some\\\\path\\\\ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"\\n   ```\\n\\n4. **Prepend Command with `winpty`:**\\n   If you are using Git Bash or another terminal emulator, try prepending your Docker run command with `winpty`:\\n   ```bash\\n   winpty docker run -it \\\\\\n   -e POSTGRES_USER=\"root\" \\\\\\n   -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=\"root\" \\\\\\n   -e POSTGRES_DB=\"ny_taxi\" \\\\\\n   -v /c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \\\\\\n   -p 5432:5432 \\\\\\n   postgres:1\\n   ```\\n\\n5. **Use $(pwd):**\\n   A possible solution includes using `$(pwd)` to dynamically get the current directory:\\n   ```bash\\n   -v \"/$(pwd)/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"\\n   ```\\n\\n6. **Empty Volume Name:**\\n   If the path-based volume mounting continues to fail, consider using a named volume instead of the direct path:\\n   ```bash\\n   -v ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\\n   ```\\n\\nBy trying these steps, you should be able to correct the invalid reference format error and successfully map your volumes on Windows using Docker.'"

       "'It seems like you\\'re encountering a common issue with connecting to PostgreSQL on port 5432. Here are several steps you can take to resolve the problem based on our FAQ database:\\n\\n1. **Change the Port**: The port 5432 might be occupied by another PostgreSQL instance on your machine. Try changing the port from 5432 to another port like 5431. For example:\\n   ```python\\n   engine = create_engine(\\'postgresql://root:root@localhost:5431/ny_taxi\\')\\n   ```\\n   This way, you can avoid conflicts with the existing PostgreSQL instance.\\n\\n2. **Check for Running PostgreSQL Services**:\\n   - On **Windows**: Verify if there\\'s a PostgreSQL service running. Stop the service to free up the port.\\n   - On **MacOS**: Use the following commands to troubleshoot and stop the conflicting service:\\n     ```bash\\n     lsof -i :5432\\n     launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist\\n     ```\\n     If you need to restart it later:\\n     ```bash\\n     launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist\\n     ```\\n\\n3. **Password Authentication and Role Issues**: Ensure that the user and role specified in your connection string exists and has the correct password. If the role \"root\" does not exist, you could try using the default \"postgres\" user instead by adjusting your environment variables accordingly:\\n   ```sh\\n   POSTGRES_USER=juroot to PGUSER=postgres\\n   ```\\n\\n4. **Verify Database Existence**: Ensure that the database you are trying to connect to exists. You can check this by running:\\n   ```sh\\n   docker exec -it <your_container_name> /bin/bash\\n   psql -U postgres -l\\n   ```\\n\\n5. **Rebuild the Docker Container**: Removing the existing PostgreSQL volume and rebuilding the Docker container could solve persistent issues:\\n   ```sh\\n   docker compose down\\n   rm -rf <path_to_postgres_volume>\\n   docker compose up\\n   ```\\n\\nBy carefully following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with connecting to PostgreSQL on port 5432.
